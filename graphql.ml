My Name is Arthur, And I'm a Groceristar founder.
We're trying to build an affordable meal planning software for Foodies

I build it because it's fun and can make a difference.

I was working on this project 1 year alone. Then i decide to form a team of interns,
that want to get an experience in real startup. 
And i did it. 
Right now we have about 15 active team members.

We also working at machine learning field
We trying to teach a model to help people pick a healthy meal

I want to build a framework, that can be used in another food tech projects.

Dietology, fitness, food delivery, et setera.

So if a new startup will save time and money by using our code - I'll be happy.

Marketing and sales is our points of weakness.
